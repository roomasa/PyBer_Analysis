# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Project

The overall goal of this project was to analyze ride data in different city types: rural, urban, suburban. 

### Purpose

 The purpose of the new analysis was to determine trends in total weekly fares in the different city types. 
 

## Results

The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types are summarized below: 

1. Total number of rides were highest in the urban cities (n=1,625), followed by suburban (n=625) and were the lowest in rural cities (n=125).

2. Total number of drivers were also highest in the urban cities (n=2,405), followed by suburban cities (n=490) and lowest in rural cities (n=78).   

3. Total fares were over 9 times higher in urban cities compared to rural cities ($ 39,854 in urban cities and $ 4,328 in rural cities) and were almost half in suburban cities compared to urban cities (n=$19,356 in suburban cities).

4. Average fare per ride and driver were lowest in the urban cities at $24.53 and $ 16.57 respectively. They were highest in rural cities ($ 34.62 for average fare per ride and $ 55.49 for average fare oer driver. In suburban cities the average fare per ride was $ 30.97 and the average fare per driver was $ 39.50. 

5. Average weekly fare shows slight variations for all city types but overall were highest for urban, followed by suburban and then rural.

## Summary

Analysis of ride data shows that overall volumes of rides, number of drivers, total fare generated are highest in the urban city types and lowest in the rural city types with suburban cities falling in between.
